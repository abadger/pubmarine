Coding Guidelines
=================

* Make sure that tests are passing in travis
* Add new tests to exercise the code and keep coverage at 100%
* Run pylint on any new code.  Currently we're at 0 pylint warnings.  Let's see if we can keep it
  that way.
* This is a very rough guide so far.  It is subject to change
