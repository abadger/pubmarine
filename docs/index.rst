Welcome to Pubmarine's documentation!
=====================================

Pubmarine is an implementation of the publish-subscribe pattern for asyncio.  It is used for
intra-process communication.  "What's that", you ask, "Intra-process?"  Yep.  Intra-process.  When you create
a program that has multiple threads of control, you sometimes need an easy way to communicate
between the various pieces.  That's where pubmarine comes in.  It provides a few functions to
subscribe one thread of control to a topic and then publish events to the topic from another thread.
