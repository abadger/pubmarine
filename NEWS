Release Notes
=============

0.4.2
=====

This update just brings documentation to the release tarball.


Other Notes
-----------

- Add API docs for :mod:`pubmarine`

- Add an example that walks through creating a simplified clone of UNIX talk using :mod:`asyncio` and :mod:`pubmarine`


0.4.1
=====

Bug Fixes
---------

- Fix a traceback when calling callbacks with keyword arguments.  Keyword arguments to callbacks would not have worked at all prior to this.


0.4
===

Bug Fixes
---------

- In some circumstances, callbacks which had been deallocated in the main program were not being removed from the event_handler list.  This could lead to a small inefficiency as PubPen.publish() would continue to attempt to call them even though they were already removed.


Other Notes
-----------

- Added unittests to prevent regressions


0.3
===

New Features
------------

- Added the ability to unsubscribe from an event. :meth:`PubPen.subscribe` now returns a subscription_id that may be used with the new method, :meth:`PubPen.unsubscribe` to stop getting notified about an event.


Deprecation Notes
-----------------

- :meth:`PubPen.emit` has been deprecated.  It has been renamed to :meth:`PubPen.publish` to better match with :meth:`PubPen.subscribe`
